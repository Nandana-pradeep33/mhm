                        <p className="py-6"> Malabar Hub Meet (MHM) is a two-day annual flagship event of IEEE Malabar Hub aimed at connecting the vibrant volunteers across the Malabar Hub and cheering them up with technical and cultural exposure. The three-day arch event features top-notch programs including technical workshops, mentorship opportunities, industrial visits, and cultural programs. Attended by students spanning different colleges in the Malabar region, this event facilitates a platform for creating the building blocks of a lifelong and diverse professional network. The event caters to the inquisitive minds of young engineers by allowing them to interact with technical experts and alleviate their concerns about the working world while providing real-time industrial networking. The event also focuses on equipping the delegates with volunteering opportunities and improving their communication skills and confidence level. We promise a platform to converse and think with other enthusiastic minds through MHM. </p>

Yes, we are referring to the IEEE Malabar Hub, a networking platform for students and professionals of northern districts of Kerala viz Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod. The hub currently has 25 student branches and more than 3000 IEEE members. The Malabar hub aims to provide the best in class experience by organizing workshops, talks, internships, and conferences so that at the end of the day, we are not just engineers, but a fully-fledged techno giant dominating the tech industry. The hub invites the attention of all members to work together and organize more activities that would create an opportunity to collaborate with other IEEE members from all over the world.  </p>

                        <p className="py-6">    The IEEE Student Branch of Government Engineering College Wayanad (GECW) has created an environment for tech-savvy engineering students to develop skills and come up with innovative ideas. The SB marked its first step in August 2012. The student branch organizes technical quizzes, seminars, and other student-led competitions. Invited lectures by experts from industry and other academic institutions are also conducted. With the aspiring minds of GECW, the greatest achievement was the IEEE Regional Exemplary Student Branch Award 2022 for exemplary performance as an active IEEE Student Branch offering technical programs, activities, and professional networking opportunities that enable members to build critical skills. The most recent event that was successfully conducted was the 2nd National Symposium and Research Colloquium, which was a 2-day hybrid event. A 3-day techno-cultural event ‘illustra’ a blend of talks, workshops, and cultural was also conducted. A 3-day sight camp hosted by the IEEE SIGHT GECW to Baveli and Begur forest area ended off with a blast.  </p>
